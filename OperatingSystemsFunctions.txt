  One of the operating system's functions is to manages a computerâ€™s resources. specifically, it manages the distribution of those resources among other programs. Examples of common resources it governs are the central processing unit, computer memory, file storage, input/output devices, and network connections.
  Another function is to establish the user interface. A user interface (UI) is the part of an operating system, program, or device that allows a user to enter and receive information.  In most operating systems, the user interface is Predominantly graphical. This means that instead of typing the commands you manipulate various graphical objects like icons with a mouse or touchpad. The fundemental principles of how different graphical user interfaces (GUIs) work are very similar , so if you understand Windows UI, you will probably know how to use Linux or most other GUIs. 
  The last function is to execute and provide services for application's software. An operating system loads all types of activities into the memory and runs it. The program must be able to end its execution, either normally or abnormally.The process involves the complete execution of the written program or code. It also provides application programs (that run within an Operating system) an environment to execute it freely. It provides users the services run various programs in a convenient manner.
